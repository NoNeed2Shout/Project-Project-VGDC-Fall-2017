public class Ram : MonoBehaviour {

    //Should contain variables for a straightforward ramming attack. Maybe also adapt it to one where ramming a boundary spawns some projectiles.
    //Key for simple ramming: timer while keeping track of player (maybe make it stationary and rotating to face player for variety)
    //Include a visual cue before charge (should be a quick dash) as a "get out of the way" - probably same as the laser's?
    //Boss should be immobile for a little bit after end of charge (probably when hitting a wall) before rotating itself to default and moving back up

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
		
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		
	}
}
